Summary
This section of the data release includes tables in the format of comma-separated value (CSV)
files with elevation-area-volume relationships for Great Salt Lake. 
The volume and area of Great Salt Lake were calculated from the topobathymetric raster dataset,
which was resampled from 0.5-meter to 5.0-meter resolution, at elevation increments of 0.01 feet
between 4,170.00â€“4,215.00 ft above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Data are provided 
as total values for Great Salt Lake as well as regional values for the 
north arm, south arm, Bear River Bay, and Farmington Bay.
